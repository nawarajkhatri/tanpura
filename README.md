# ALAPANAMAC: Pure Data Music Synthesis Application
## By Nawaraj Khatri, Student No: 202308669

### Introduction
"ALAPANAMAC" is a Pure Data app that merges the traditional sounds of Tanpura and Tabla with advanced voice synthesis. This project, crafted by Nawaraj Khatri, is designed as a unique music creation tool that bridges the gap between Indian classical music and digital technology.

### Acknowledgements
Special thanks to my instructor and classmates for their invaluable support and patience, especially as I navigate learning Portuguese as an international student.

### Context of the Work
This project was born out of a need identified during my undergraduate studies in Nepal. The lack of quality Tabla and Tanpura apps on Android led me to envision a tool that would replicate the essence of Indian classical music in a digital format.

### Concept and Technical Architecture
- **Tanpura Synthesis**: Utilizes phasor objects and filters (low pass, high pass, band pass) to emulate the Tanpura sound.
- **Tabla Component**: Employs sampled sounds timed to the Teentaal beat with tempo options (125, 175, 250 BPM) and user-defined tempo input.
- **Vocal Element**: Features recorded voice in the C scale, programmed to generate two-note melodies with a reverb effect for harmony.

### Related Work and Inspirations
- Inspired by iTablaPro's approach to quality and user experience.
- Draws from contemporary projects like the AI-based Raga Music project and RiyazStudio.

### Challenges and Future Plans
- Faced challenges in sampling a comprehensive scale range for Tabla and vocals.
- Future plans include expanding the rhythm options and developing this project into an Android application.
- Potential integration with tools like ChatGPT for innovative music creation for social media content.
